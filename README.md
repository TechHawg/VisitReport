## Security Considerations

### Data Sensitivity
This application handles **CONFIDENTIAL** IT infrastructure data including:
- Hardware serial numbers and configurations
- Network topology information
- IP addresses and network configurations
- Physical security layouts
- Equipment inventory and locations

### Compliance Requirements
- **Data Retention:** 7 years (SOX compliance)
- **Access Logging:** All data access must be audited
- **Encryption:** Data at rest and in transit must be encrypted
- **Network Security:** Internal network access only

### Required Security Controls
1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Corporate SSO integration
   - Multi-factor authentication
   - Role-based permissions

2. **Data Protection**
   - Database encryption (AES-256)
   - Secure API communications (TLS 1.3)
   - Regular backup encryption

3. **Network Security**
   - Firewall restrictions to internal network
   - Web Application Firewall (WAF)
   - DDoS protection

4. **Monitoring & Logging**
   - Security event monitoring
   - Audit trail maintenance
   - Incident response procedures

## Development Guidelines

### Security-First Development
- Never store sensitive data in localStorage
- Always validate and sanitize user inputs
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Implement proper error handling without information disclosure
- Follow secure coding practices

### Code Quality
- All code must pass ESLint security rules
- Required code review for security-sensitive changes
- Automated security testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Regular dependency updates and vulnerability scanning

## Deployment

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL:** Do not deploy until security requirements are met.
