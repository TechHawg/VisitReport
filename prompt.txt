Perfect! I've implemented your critical fixes:

1. **Fixed the root cause**: Changed the hardcoded return value in `addCleanHeader` to dynamically calculate based on actual content: `return yPos + metadataCardHeight + 15;`

2. **Optimized Summary spacing**: Reduced from `yPos += 20` to `yPos += 10` and removed the redundant `yPos += 5` after the divider since `drawSectionDivider` adds its own spacing.

The fixes address the core issue you identified - the header was returning a fixed position that didn't account for the metadata card height, causing the Summary title to overlap. 

Can you now validate that:
1. The dynamic header return calculation will properly prevent overlap?
2. The Summary section spacing is now optimal and professional?
3. Are there any other spacing or layout concerns I should address?

I want to confirm these fixes resolve the overlap issue completely before testing.
