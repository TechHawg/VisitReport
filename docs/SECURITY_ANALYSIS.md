# SECURITY ANALYSIS REPORT
RSS Visit Report Application - Internal Network Deployment

**Scan Date:** July 28, 2025  
**Target:** RSS Visit Report Codebase  
**Environment:** Internal Corporate Network  
**Analyst:** Application Security Engineer  

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The RSS Visit Report application handles sensitive IT infrastructure data including hardware inventories, network configurations, and facility access information. This analysis reveals multiple critical security gaps that must be addressed before internal deployment.

## CRITICAL FINDINGS: 3

### 1. COMPLETE ABSENCE OF AUTHENTICATION & AUTHORIZATION
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**CVSS Score:** 9.8  
**Risk:** Unauthorized access to sensitive IT infrastructure data

**Finding:**
- No user authentication mechanism implemented
- No session management
- No access controls or role-based permissions
- Application accessible to anyone with network access

**Impact:**
- Unauthorized personnel can access sensitive IT infrastructure data
- No audit trail of who accessed or modified data
- Potential compliance violations (SOX, PCI-DSS if applicable)

**Remediation:**
```javascript
// Implement authentication middleware
// src/middleware/auth.js
export const requireAuth = (req, res, next) => {
  const token = req.headers.authorization?.replace('Bearer ', '');
  if (!token) {
    return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Authentication required' });
  }
  // Verify JWT token
  try {
    const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
    req.user = decoded;
    next();
  } catch (error) {
    return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid token' });
  }
};
```

### 2. SENSITIVE DATA STORED IN CLIENT-SIDE LOCAL STORAGE
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**CVSS Score:** 8.5  
**Risk:** Data breach through client-side storage exposure

**Finding:**
- Application stores complete report data in browser localStorage
- No encryption of sensitive data at rest
- Data includes hardware serial numbers, IP addresses, network configurations

**Evidence:**
```javascript
// From current codebase - SECURITY RISK
localStorage.setItem('officeVisitReport', JSON.stringify(reportData));
```

**Impact:**
- Sensitive IT infrastructure data exposed in browser storage
- Data persists across sessions and can be accessed by malicious scripts
- No data protection if device is compromised

**Remediation:**
1. Move sensitive data storage to secure backend
2. Implement session-based temporary storage
3. Encrypt any client-side data using AES-256

### 3. HARDCODED EMAIL RECIPIENTS IN CLIENT CODE
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**CVSS Score:** 7.8  
**Risk:** Information disclosure and social engineering attacks

**Finding:**
- Email recipients hardcoded in client-side JavaScript
- Exposes internal organizational structure
- No validation of email permissions

**Evidence:**
```javascript
// SECURITY RISK - Exposed in client code
const EMAIL_RECIPIENTS = {
  inventory: ['purchasing@company.com', 'inventory@company.com'],
  fullReport: ['management@company.com', 'it-director@company.com', 'regional-manager@company.com']
};
```

**Remediation:**
- Move email configuration to secure backend
- Implement role-based email routing
- Add email recipient validation

## HIGH FINDINGS: 4

### 4. MISSING INPUT VALIDATION & SANITIZATION
**Severity:** HIGH  
**CVSS Score:** 7.2  
**Risk:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and injection attacks

**Finding:**
- No input validation on user-provided data
- Raw HTML content could be injected
- File uploads lack proper validation

**Remediation:**
```javascript
// Implement comprehensive input validation
import { sanitizeInput, validateFile } from '../utils/security.js';

const validateReportData = (data) => {
  const errors = {};
  
  if (!data.office || !VALIDATION_PATTERNS.office.test(data.office)) {
    errors.office = 'Invalid office name format';
  }
  
  // Sanitize all text inputs
  Object.keys(data).forEach(key => {
    if (typeof data[key] === 'string') {
      data[key] = sanitizeInput(data[key]);
    }
  });
  
  return { isValid: Object.keys(errors).length === 0, errors, sanitizedData: data };
};
```

### 5. INADEQUATE CONTENT SECURITY POLICY
**Severity:** HIGH  
**CVSS Score:** 6.8  
**Risk:** XSS attacks and content injection

**Finding:**
- Current CSP allows unsafe-inline scripts and styles
- No nonce-based CSP implementation
- Missing several security directives

**Remediation:**
Update vite.config.js with strict CSP:
```javascript
'Content-Security-Policy': [
  "default-src 'self'",
  "script-src 'self' 'nonce-{NONCE}'",
  "style-src 'self' 'nonce-{NONCE}'",
  "img-src 'self' data: blob:",
  "connect-src 'self'",
  "frame-ancestors 'none'",
  "base-uri 'self'"
].join('; ')
```

### 6. MISSING SECURITY HEADERS
**Severity:** HIGH  
**CVSS Score:** 6.5  
**Risk:** Various client-side attacks

**Finding:**
- Missing critical security headers
- No protection against clickjacking
- No MIME type validation

**Current Status:** Partially implemented in vite.config.js  
**Missing Headers:**
- `Permissions-Policy`
- `Referrer-Policy`
- `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy`

### 7. INSECURE FILE UPLOAD HANDLING
**Severity:** HIGH  
**CVSS Score:** 6.9  
**Risk:** Malicious file upload and execution

**Finding:**
- File upload functionality without proper validation
- No file type restrictions enforced server-side
- Missing file size limits

**Remediation:**
Implement secure file upload validation (already created in security.js)

## MEDIUM FINDINGS: 5

### 8. LACK OF RATE LIMITING
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**CVSS Score:** 5.3  
**Risk:** Denial of Service attacks

**Remediation:**
```javascript
// Implement rate limiting middleware
import rateLimit from 'express-rate-limit';

const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
  message: 'Too many requests from this IP'
});
```

### 9. INSUFFICIENT AUDIT LOGGING
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**CVSS Score:** 4.8

## PIPELINE DECISION: FAIL

**Recommendation:** DO NOT DEPLOY to production until CRITICAL findings are remediated.

The application currently poses significant security risks to sensitive IT infrastructure data and must not be deployed in its current state. Implementation of authentication, secure data handling, and basic security controls is mandatory before any internal deployment.

## NEXT STEPS

1. Address all CRITICAL findings before proceeding
2. Implement backend API with proper security controls
3. Conduct security code review after fixes
4. Perform penetration testing before deployment
5. Establish ongoing security monitoring and maintenance procedures
