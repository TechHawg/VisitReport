# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Quick Setup

Your RSS Visit Report System is now configured for GitHub Pages deployment! Here's how to get it live:

### 1. Push to GitHub Repository

Make sure your repository is pushed to GitHub and the main branch contains all the latest changes.

### 2. Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/RSS_Visit_Report`
2. Click on **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section in the left sidebar
4. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**
5. Save the settings

### 3. Automatic Deployment

The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:
- ✅ Build your app whenever you push to `main` branch  
- ✅ Run tests (if configured)
- ✅ Deploy to GitHub Pages
- ✅ Provide a live URL

## 🌐 Access Your App

After deployment completes (2-5 minutes), your app will be available at:

```
https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/RSS_Visit_Report/
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

# Build for GitHub Pages
npm run build:github

# Preview the build
npm run preview:github
```

## 🔄 Deployment Workflow

1. **Push to main** → Triggers automatic build
2. **GitHub Actions** → Runs build process
3. **Deploy** → Updates live site
4. **Live in ~5 minutes** → Your changes are live!

## 🛠️ Manual Deployment

You can also trigger deployment manually:
1. Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
2. Click **Deploy to GitHub Pages** workflow
3. Click **Run workflow** button
