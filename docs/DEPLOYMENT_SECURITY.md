## NETWORK SECURITY CONFIGURATION

### Firewall Rules
```
# Allow HTTPS traffic from internal network only
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -s 10.0.0.0/8 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -s 172.16.0.0/12 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -s 192.168.0.0/16 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j DROP

# Block all external access
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j DROP
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8080 -j DROP
```

### Load Balancer Configuration
```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name rss-visit-report.internal.company.com;
    
    # SSL Configuration

    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_ciphers ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA512:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA512;
    
    # Security Headers
    add_header X-Frame-Options DENY;
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff;
    add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block";
    add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains";
    
    # Rate Limiting
    limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=api:10m rate=10r/s;
    limit_req zone=api burst=20 nodelay;
    
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://backend;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

## MONITORING & LOGGING

### Required Monitoring

- [ ] Security event monitoring (SIEM integration)
- [ ] File integrity monitoring
- [ ] Network traffic monitoring
- [ ] Database access monitoring

### Audit Logging Configuration
```javascript
// Required audit events
const AUDIT_EVENTS = {
  USER_LOGIN: 'user_login',
  USER_LOGOUT: 'user_logout',

  DATA_MODIFICATION: 'data_modification',
  REPORT_GENERATION: 'report_generation',
  EMAIL_SENT: 'email_sent',
  FILE_UPLOAD: 'file_upload',
  UNAUTHORIZED_ACCESS: 'unauthorized_access'
};
```
